If a Linux process becomes unresponsive or is consuming too many resources, you may need to kill it.
Most processes have their own methods of shutting down. Unfortunately, processes can malfunction and not allow themselves to be shut down. If a running background process is unresponsive, it becomes necessary to use a command to kill it.
Here’s a complete guide on how to kill a Linux process using the command line.
iWhat Processes Can You Kill in Linux?
Before killing or terminating a process, you need to consider permissions.
A root user can kill all processes. You can either add sudo before a command to run it as root, or obtain a root shell with su. Then execute the command.
Killing a process sends a termination message to the given process. There are multiple types of termination messages including:
SIGKILL – SIGKILL is the ultimate way of killing a process. It will always kill a process and will kill the process abruptly, generating a fatal error. SIGKILL should always work. If it does not work, the operating system has failed.
SIGTERM – SIGTERM attempts to kill a process, but unlike SIGKILL it may be blocked or otherwise handled. It can be considered a gentler way of attempting to terminate a process.
For most purposes, SIGKILL will be the fastest and most effective method to terminate the process.

The top command is the easiest way to get a complete overview of the processes currently being run.
To view a list of all currently running processes, use the command:
